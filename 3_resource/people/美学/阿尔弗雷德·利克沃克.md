Front Dike 9, Hamburg-Reitbrook, Lichtwark's birthplace.

Alfred Lichtwark was the son of Herr Johann Karl Ernst Lichtwark, a minor lord who owned the [Reitbrook Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reitbrook_Mill&action=edit&redlink=1 "Reitbrook Mill (page does not exist)"). From his father's first marriage he had three half-siblings. Alfred Lichtwark's mother Johanne Helene Henrietta (née Bach) (1829–1909) was believed to be a direct descendant of the composer [Johann Sebastian Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach "Johann Sebastian Bach"). Lichtwark had a happy childhood in the countryside with his siblings Hans and Marianne (1857–1930) until 1858, when his father was forced to sell the mill for financial reasons. The family moved to Hamburg, where his father ran an inn which fared poorly, and the family lived in poverty. Lichtwark, who attended the civil school, proved to be very talented and versatile, helping students after school as an assistant teacher. In 1873 he took the _[Abitur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abitur "Abitur")_ at the _[Christianeum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianeum_Hamburg "Christianeum Hamburg")_ in [Altona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altona,_Hamburg "Altona, Hamburg"). A grant by [Justus Brinckmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justus_Brinckmann "Justus Brinckmann") helped finance his studies in arts and education in [Dresden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden "Dresden"), Leipzig, and [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin "Berlin"). After finishing his studies he worked at several [primary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksschule "Volksschule") and civil schools in Berlin. Lichtwark was very disenchanted with the educational system that existed at that time in [Imperial Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Germany "Imperial Germany"), which led him to the idea of a new kind of school or pedagogy.
